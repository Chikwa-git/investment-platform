# Investment Platform (Work in Progress)

## Overview

Investment Platform is a web-based project designed to help beginner investors better understand stock market information without being overwhelmed by complex financial data.

The goal is to present essential indicators in a simplified and educational way, helping users understand not only market movements but also the meaning behind the data they are viewing.

The platform focuses on clarity, accessibility, and financial education rather than advanced trading tools.

---

## Problem

Many beginner investors struggle with information overload. Most platforms present large amounts of technical indicators without explaining their relevance or practical meaning.

This project aims to bridge the gap between raw financial data and user understanding.

---

## Proposed Solution

The platform will:

- Aggregate key investment indicators relevant for beginners
- Provide simplified explanations of financial metrics
- Connect market movements with recent relevant events
- Use AI-assisted summaries to explain how news and facts may relate to price variations

---

## Current Status

🚧 Early development phase (architecture and backend experimentation).

Currently exploring:
- API integrations
- Local server testing
- Data structure design
- Backend foundations

The project is focused on learning and iterative development rather than rapid feature delivery.

---

## Development Approach

This project is being developed as a learning-driven workflow, following real software development stages such as ideation, design, architecture planning, and incremental implementation.

AI tools are used as discussion and mentoring assistants to support decision-making and learning, while implementation decisions and coding remain human-driven.

---

## Next Steps

- Define backend architecture
- Implement initial API integrations
- Design MVP user flow
- Start frontend prototyping

---

## Project Status

Work in progress — active learning project.
